### Directory Structure

The directory structure used herein to manage documents and files is as follows:

At the top level, files describing the project meant for users to read: ```README.md```. The only other files that would be expected here is a ```.gitignore``` file, listing files and/or folders which Git should ignore and a ```.git``` file, containing git metadata. There is one subdirectory of this structure: ```/src```

**Responses to all homework questions are located in the ```/src``` subdirectory in the ```homework-5-Matthew-Montoya.md``` file.**
